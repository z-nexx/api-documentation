## Image Service API

### Service Description
Image Service API allows uploading of product images to be stored and used within the iZettle applications.
The service returns a `imageUrl` that can be added to a desired product using the Product Library API.
The images can be uploaded using a byte array or a static URL, the image will be eventually available for lookup from
within the iZettle apps or via the `imageUrls` returned by the service (See Swagger documentation for upload restrictions).

`NOTE: JPG does not exist as an imageFormat, you must use JPEG for .jpg images`
